# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "master" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install # 或者使用 yarn、pip、cargo、mvn等，根据项目依赖管理工具
  
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build # 或者执行对应的构建命令，如 make build、mvn package 等

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script

          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
